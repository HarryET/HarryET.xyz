# 2022 Recap

My 2022 has been an eventful year, from finishing my GCSEs and starting A-Levels to getting a job at
[WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com). I thought I would make this blog post to recap the year and
reflect on my plans for next year.

## GCSEs
For the half of this year my focus was passing my GCSEs and moving on from high school; surprisingly I managed to
achieve grades comparable to my target grades, resulting in:
- English Lit: 6 (B)
- English Lang: 5 (C)
- Science: 6-7 (B-A)
- Maths: 7 (A)
- Comp Sci: 9 (A**)
- Product Design: 7 (A)
- Geography: 6 (B)
- Creative iMedia: L2D (A)

This allowed me to move onto the next stage of education within the UK, but first I had what was supposed to be
one of the best summer holidays ever from the end of June to the start of September. Instead of doing nothing I decided
I would ask around for an internship at some of the companies I had worked with in the past and/or had good relations
with.

## Summer Internship
After asking a few companies I decided to join [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com) as a Cloud Engineer over the
summer. Working on their [Cloud App](https://cloud.walletconnect.com), open-source and more.

While there I got to know the amazing people on the team there and expand my work to other parts of the company getting
to work on projects that interested me and power over 20,000 messages per second.

### EthCC
In the middle of July I traveled to EthCC\[5\] where I got to meet everyone in person and explore Paris. Working with
the team that I had gotten to know over Slack/Discord in-person was an amazing experience that I will remember forever.

After watching [Pedro's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeG6p6-1E30&list=PLhM7rBgpVV-JnmRLUbd10ELntN3LFfmKH&index=22)
at EthCC we had the WalletConnect Boat Party where I got to meet people from many other companies such as: [ENS](https://ens.domains/), [1kx](https://1kx.capital/), and more.

### The End of my Internship
As my internship came to an end I had moved towards writing more Rust and working with the team who build out the relay
and accompanying infrastructure. Knowing that I had to go back to school was sad but luckily I was offered a part-time
job to stay on with the team and continue the work I started on the Push API.

## A-Levels
In September I moved to study my A-Levels at Sir John Dean's, I chose: Computer Science, Maths, and Electronics, all
subjects that I enjoy and was excited to study over the next 2 years. Starting at a new school that was much larger
than any I had go to before was hard but I have made an amazing group of friends so that ever day there is fun and I'm
excited to see how the next 18 months there are.

## Distributed Systems Engineer
I started as a Rust Distributed Systems Engineer at [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com) to continue the
work I started on the Push API. For this blog post I did a bit of number crunching to figure out how much I had done
up-to this point (152 Days) I have the following stats:
- ‚ûï Lines Added: 62955
- ‚ûñ Lines Removed: 21562
- üì¶ Repositories Work On: 19
- üß© Features Launched: 4

## EthLisbon
For the 28th-30th of October I was in Lisbon with WalletConnect where I helped at the Booth and spoke to hackers there
trying to integrate our newly released [Web3Modal v2](https://web3modal.com) as part of our bounties. I also got to
explore the city and make some new friends who I continue to talk too.

## Ongoing Open Source
This year I made 1,773 contributions across server open-source projects. Some highlights were:
- [gleam-lang/gleam](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam)
- [supabase/gotrue](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue)
- [nyxx-discord/nyxx](https://github.com/nyxx-discord/nyxx)
- [harryet/shimmer](https://github.com/harryet/shimmer)
- [walletconnect/echo-server](https://github.com/walletconnect/echo-server)
- and many more...
The full data will be available [here](/git/2022) soon

# Next Year
I thought I'd take some time to share some events going on next year and some goals I have...

## FOSDEM'23
I have been invited to speak at FOSDEM'23 and will be doing an introduction to [Gleam](https://gleam.run) on the
Sunday (5th February 2023). It will be available as a video later and I plan on writing a follow-up blog post
summarize my talk as well as talk about what I had to do for my first talk.

## Contributing to [Gleam](https://gleam.run)
This year I discovered Gleam and I'd love to continue contributing next year as well as finally finish
[Shimmer](https://github.com/HarryET/shimmer) and the [Packages Website](https://lpil/packages) that I started this
year.

To summarize the contributions I made this year:
- ‚ûï Lines Added: 1720
- ‚ûñ Lines Removed: 6630
- üß© Features Launched: 1
- üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Pull Requests: 13
- üö® Issues Opened: 4

## Launching the Push API
Continuing the work I have done at WalletConnect this year I'm excited to get the first alpha of the Push API out
to wallets and dApps so we can get some feedback and have people running [Echo Server](https://github.com/walletconect/echo-server)
to support their notifications.

### Supporting
If you want to support me I'm planning to set-up Github Sponsors, https://github.com/sponsors/harryet, where you can
support me and my open-source. A follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theharryet) or [GitHub](https://github.com/harryet)
is equally appreciated and you can watch what happens in 2023!
